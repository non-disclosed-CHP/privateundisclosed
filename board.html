            I enlisted in the Marine Corps in September 2003 as an Air Traffic Control Maintenance
            Radar Technician. Since my enlistment, I have spent eight years in Okinawa, Japan,
            and 13 months in Al-Taqqadum, Iraq. Over my career, I have attended multiple Enlisted
            Professional Military Education Courses and was honored to graduate from the Sergeant’s
            Course as a Distinguished Graduate. In addition to these courses, I also graduated from the
            Weapons and Tactics Instructor course at Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics
            Squadron 1. Finally, I completed a B.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy with a
            certificate in Project Management, and I am pursuing an MBA in Accounting with a diploma
            in Executive Coaching.

            I have always found pleasure in volunteer work, which has included volunteer
            firefighting, opening a coffee house at the MCAS Futenma Chapel, and serving as a
            Board Member for the Kinser Elementary School Parent Teacher Organization.
