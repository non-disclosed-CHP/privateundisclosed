            I enlisted in the Marine Corps in September 2003 as an Air Traffic Control Maintenance
            Radar Technician. Since my enlistment, I have spent eight years in Okinawa, Japan,
            and 13 months in Al-Taqqadum, Iraq. Over my career, I have attended multiple Enlisted
            Professional Military Education Courses and was honored to graduate from the Sergeant’s
            Course as a Distinguished Graduate. In addition to these courses, I also graduated from the
            Weapons and Tactics Instructor course at Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics
            Squadron 1. Finally, I completed a B.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy with a
            certificate in Project Management, and I am pursuing an MBA in Accounting with a diploma
            in Executive Coaching.
          </p>

            I wish to volunteer with SVA at AMU to create a mutually supportive community for

            I have always found pleasure in volunteer work, which has included volunteer
            firefighting, opening a coffee house at the MCAS Futenma Chapel, and serving as a
            Board Member for the Kinser Elementary School Parent Teacher Organization.

developed my philosophy throughout my 19-year
military career and is centered around the heart
of my teammates.

I have passion for leadership development and strong ambition to make the workplace better across the
Nation. A current initiative I’m working on is authoring my book on how I developed my leadership
philosophy and the concept behind it. Additionally, I have an ambition to start my own leadership
development company. I also earned a Business Development Consultant Internship with the KYO group
which will begin February 2026 which will lead me to my 20-year Military retirement.
In my current capacity, I am the leader of a Security Forces Flight consisting of 32 Airmen conducting Law
Enforcement and Security functions. I have served as a Flight Chief for four years. I earned my M.A. in
Management in 2023 and was inducted into the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS) which
is the top 5% in the Nation for Leadership degrees. I now serve as a facilitator with the NSLS for the
Success Networking Group Meetings. This includes mentorship, development, and giving advice for NSLS
Nominees working to earn their induction.
My past key leadership experience consists of being the Airman Dorm Leader Superintendent where I
mentored thousands of Airmen and managed multi-million-dollar contracts. I xwas nominated as the top 5%
of the Career Field and named Honorary Engineer by my unit.
As apparent from my philosophy of “Leading Through Humanism” and my experience, I have a passion to
