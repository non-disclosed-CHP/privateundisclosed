            I enlisted in the Marine Corps in September 2003 as an Air Traffic Control Maintenance
            Radar Technician. Since my enlistment, I have spent eight years in Okinawa, Japan,
            and 13 months in Al-Taqqadum, Iraq. Over my career, I have attended multiple Enlisted
            Professional Military Education Courses and was honored to graduate from the Sergeant’s
            Course as a Distinguished Graduate. In addition to these courses, I also graduated from the
            Weapons and Tactics Instructor course at Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics
            Squadron 1. Finally, I completed a B.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy with a
            certificate in Project Management, and I am pursuing an MBA in Accounting with a diploma
            in Executive Coaching.

            leadership skills. His role as an ARCC involves extensive administrative work, from managing soldier career transitions, 
            reenlistments, and transfers to maintaining detailed records and preparing reports—all of which require high precision 
            and organizational expertise. These responsibilities and his experience in various leadership positions during deployments

            SFC Miller’s extensive administrative experience as an Army Reserve Career Counselor, strong leadership skills, and attention 
            to detail make him exceptionally well-qualified for the role of SVA Secretary. His leadership skills, honed during his various

        <p>
            My name is David Terry, and like my father, I am a Marine. I have been active duty for 15 years and am currently stationed at the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing in New Orleans, LA. My trade is aviation electrician, and I also serve as the 4th MAW class desk while awaiting the results of the Warrant Officer Board.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            I have been married for 13 years and have two sons. We have relocated often, and we look forward to returning to Japan at some point. I am currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in business management and plan to pursue my master’s degree afterward.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            As a Regional Ambassador, I am excited to support our Chapter locally, fostering a strong community for student veterans and their families.
