                            <p>General Mattis‚Äô remarkable journey in the U.S. Marine Corps began at Central Washington University through ROTC, leading to his commission as a Second Lieutenant in 1972. His career trajectory set him on a path to some of the highest leadership positions within the military.</p>
                            <p>Throughout his storied career, General Mattis commanded with distinction at every level. From overseeing marine recruiting in Portland to earning a Bronze Star as the leader of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, in the Gulf War, his ascent was marked by strategic foresight and unshakeable resolve.</p>
                            <p>As a Major General, his leadership in the Iraq War, particularly during the battle of Fallujah, showcased his strategic mastery.</p>
                            <p>General Mattis is renowned for his candid commentary, always emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct and the broader implications of military actions.</p>
                            <p>A testament to his dedication to continuous learning, General Mattis is a distinguished alumnus of the Marine Corps Amphibious Warfare School, Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and the National War College. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in History.</p>

                            <p>General Mattis‚Äô character shines through in an anecdote from Christmas Day 1998. When Marine General Charles C. Krulak was delivering holiday cookies to Marines, he discovered that Mattis had stepped in for a young major, allowing him to spend the holiday with his family. This act reflected Mattis‚Äô respect and care for his fellow service members.</p>
                            <p>General Mattis is a beacon of military excellence, ethical leadership, and selfless service. His career is a testament to tactical brilliance and the deep humanity that underpins true leadership.</p>

                    üéñÔ∏è 2023 Veterans Day Honor Wall: Remembering Medgar Evers

                    Today, we are called to remember the bravery and enduring spirit of Medgar Wiley Evers, a veteran whose battle did not end upon leaving the theater of war but carried on in the pursuit of justice and equality within his own nation.

                    üåü Born in the clutches of segregation, Medgar Evers was a witness to the stark injustices of his time. It was his service to our country during World War II, in a segregated African American battalion, that honed his courage and commitment to fight for a more equitable America.

                    üó≥Ô∏è His transition from a soldier to a civil rights activist was seamless, as he put his life on the line to secure voting rights for African Americans in his home state of Mississippi.

                    Evers' relentless pursuit of civil liberties included the poignant reminder that ‚Äúyou can kill a man, but you can‚Äôt kill an idea.‚Äù His tragic assassination reverberated across the nation, galvanizing support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

                    üïäÔ∏è Medgar Evers‚Äô commitment and ultimate sacrifice were not in vain. The passage of the Civil Rights Act stands as a testament to his vision of a fairer world, a vision that continues to inspire the fight for civil rights to this day.

                        Completing higher education is not just for getting a job, or receiving an edge once you've completed your studies. It's your opportunity to network and grow into who you want to be. It's about YOU. Prospective employers see degrees as your ability to commit to goals. However, where YOU gain value is gaining lived experiences through the journey. Never pass up an opportunity to help someone, meet new friends with different hobbies, or face challenges. They all build your character. Reset your mindset while in academia. See the opportunities in each challenge. Who knows, you might end up as a Vice President of a company or better. I'm rooting for you.
